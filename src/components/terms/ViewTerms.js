                <br /><br />
                The Takeaways who work with us provide us with their menus which we will display for them on our Portal. If this information does include allergy or dietary information we will provide it. However sometimes they do not meet such a requirement. If you or someone who you will be sharing food with has a food allergies, intolerance or any other requirement we firmly advise that you contact the Takeaway directly and let them know. Please make sure you call the Takeaway. As leaving a note in your order is not always sufficient. 
                <br /><br />
                In the context of this agreement, “consequential loss” includes any consequential loss, indirect loss, real or anticipated loss of profit, loss of benefit, loss of revenue, loss of business, loss of goodwill, loss of opportunity, loss of savings, loss of reputation, loss of use and/or loss or corruption of data, whether under statute, contract, equity, tort (including negligence), indemnity or otherwise.

                The delivery time we estimate at the start is provided by the Takeaways. Please note that they are just estimates. Neither Grub24 nor the Takeaway can guarantee that the Order will be delivered/ready for collection in the estimated time.
                <br /><br />
                Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you. 
                <br /><br />
                The above-mentioned waivers do not in any means affect your statutory rights against any Takeaway.
